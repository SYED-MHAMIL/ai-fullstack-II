## Relationships
- One User has Many Tasks (one-to-many relationship)
- Tasks are owned by a single User
- Users cannot access other users' tasks

## Validation Rules
- Task.title: Required, 1-255 characters
- Task.description: Optional, 0-1000 characters
- Task.completed: Boolean, defaults to false
- Task.priority: Must be one of 'Low', 'Medium', 'High'
- Task.dueDate: Optional, must be a valid ISO date string with timezone
- Task.userId: Required, must reference an existing user ID

## State Transitions
- Task.completed: false → true (when marked complete)
- Task.completed: true → false (when unmarked)

## Indexes
- Task.userId: For efficient user-based queries
- Task.createdAt: For chronological sorting
- Task.dueDate: For deadline-based sorting/filtering
- Task.completed: For filtering by completion status
